# FlickrFeed

An in-browser app that returns images and respective details from Flickr, featuring dynamic search functionality. Built using Angular.

Typing in a search term returns images that have been tagged with the term, lisitng them in order of recent upload. The user can visit the author's Flickr page and see the image on Flickr, and see more details about the image including tags by clicking on the image itself.

Possible future developments and fixes:

- Applying an Ionic wrapper
- Params currently refresh on page reload, which requires fixing.
- Deploy to Heroku
- Infinite scrolling rather than scrollbar div
